## Course description

This course gives an introduction to time series analysis using
time domain methods and frequency domain methods. The goal is to
acquire the theoretical and computational skills required to investigate
data collected as a time series. The first half of the course will develop 
classical time series methodology, including auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) models, regression with ARMA errors, and estimation of the spectral density.
The second half of the course will focus on state space model techniques for fitting structured dynamic models to time series data. We will progress from fitting linear, Gaussian dynamic models to fitting nonlinear models for which Monte Carlo methods are required.
Examples will be drawn from ecology, economics, epidemiology, finance and elsewhere.
