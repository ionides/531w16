1. Define different concepts for stationarity.

2. Define white noise.

3. Use white noise to construct some basic time series models.

<br>

----------------------

## Definition: Weak stationarity and strict stationarity

* A time series model which is both mean stationary and covariance stationary is called **weakly stationary**.

* A time series model for which all joint distributions are invariant to shifts in time is called **strictly stationary**. 

    + Formally, this means that for any collection of times $(t_1, t_2,\dots,t_K)$, the joint distribution of observations at these times should be the same as the joint distribution at $(t_1+\tau, t_2+\tau,\dots,t_K+\tau)$ for any $\tau$.

    + For equally spaced observations, this becomes: for any collection of timepoints $n_1,\dots,n_K$, and for any lag $h$, the joint density function of $(X_{n_1},X_{n_2},\dots, X_{n_K})$ is the same as the joint density function of $(X_{n_1+h},X_{n_2+h},\dots, X_{n_K+h})$.

    + In our general notation for densities, this strict stationarity requirement can be written as
$$\begin{eqnarray}&&f_{X_{n_1},X_{n_2},\dots, X_{n_K}}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_K)\\
&&\quad\quad = f_{X_{n_1+h},X_{n_2+h},\dots, X_{n_K+h}}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_K).
\end{eqnarray}$$

   + Strict stationarity implies weak stationarity (check this). Note that we only defined weak stationarity for equally spaced observations.

Question: How could we assess whether a strictly stationary model is appropriate for a time series dataset?

### Question: Is it usual for time series to be well modeled as stationary (either weakly or strictly)?

ANSWER: It sometimes happens. However, systems often change over time, and that may be one of the things we are interested in.

---------

---------

### Question: If data do not often show stationary behavior, why do many fundamental models have stationarity?

<br>

----------

### Question: Is a stationary model appropriate for the time series below? Find arguments both ways, and try to reconcile them.

```{r stationarity_sim, echo=FALSE}
N <- 500
times <- 1:N
T1 <- 120
T2 <- 37
set.seed(73413)
y <- sin(2*pi*(times/T1 + runif(1))) +   sin(2*pi*(times/T2 + runif(1))) + rnorm(N)
x <- y[1:50]
oldpars <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(x,ty="l",xlab="")
plot(y,ty="l",xlab="")
par(oldpars)
```

## White noise

A time series model $\epsilon_{1:N}$ which is weakly stationary with 
$$\begin{eqnarray}
\E[\epsilon_n]&=& 0 \\
\cov(\epsilon_m,\epsilon_n) &=& \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \sigma^2, & \mbox{if $m=n$} \\
   0, & \mbox{if $m\neq n$} \end{array}\right. ,
\end{eqnarray}$$
is said to be **white noise** with variance $\sigma^2$.

* The "noise" is because there's no pattern, just random variation. If you listened to a realization of white noise as an audio file, you would hear a static sound.

* The "white" is because all freqencies are equally represented. This will become clear when we do frequency domain analysis of time series.

* Signal processing---sending and receiving signals on noisy channels---was a motivation for early time series analysis.

<br>

----------

----------

### Example: Gaussian white noise

In time series analysis, a sequence of independent identically distributed (IID) Normal random variables with mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$ is known as **Gaussian white noise**. We write this model as
$$ \epsilon_{1:N} \sim \mbox{IID } N[0,\sigma^2].$$
 
<br>

--------

---------

### Example: Binary white noise

Let $\epsilon_{1:N}$ be IID with
$$\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_n = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  1, & \mbox{with probability $1/2$} \\
  -1, & \mbox{with probability $1/2$} \end{array}\right. .
\end{eqnarray}$$
We can check that $\E[\epsilon_n]=0$, $\var(\epsilon_n)=1$ and $\cov(\epsilon_m,\epsilon_n)=0$ for $m\neq n$. Therefore, $\epsilon_{1:N}$ is white noise. 

Similarly, for any $p\in (0,1)$, we could have 
$$\begin{eqnarray}
\epsilon_n = \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  (1-p)/p, & \mbox{with probability $p$} \\
  -1, & \mbox{with probability $1-p$} \end{array}\right. .
\end{eqnarray}$$

<br>

--------

---------


### Example: Sinusoidal white noise 

Let $\epsilon_n = \sin(2\pi n U)$, with a single draw $U\sim\mathrm{Uniform}[0,1]$ determining the time series model for all $n\in 1:N$.

<br>

**A**. Show that $\epsilon_{1:N}$ is weakly stationary, and is white noise!

<br>

**B**. Show that $\epsilon_{1:N}$ is NOT strictly stationary.

<br>

* These are exercises in working with sines and cosines. 

* As well as providing a concrete example of a weakly stationary time series that is not strictly stationary, practice working with sines and cosines will come in handy later when we work in the frequency domain.

* As a hint for B, consider the following plot of $\epsilon_{1:3}$ as a function of $U$.
$\epsilon_1$ is shown as the black solid line; $\epsilon_2$ is the red dashed line; $\epsilon_3$ is the blue dot-dash line.

```{r sinusoidal,echo=FALSE}
np <- 500
U <- seq(from=0,to=1,length=np)
epsilon1 <- sin(2*pi*U)
epsilon2 <- sin(2*pi*2*U)
epsilon3 <- sin(2*pi*3*U)
matplot(U,cbind(epsilon1,epsilon2,epsilon3),col=c("black","red","blue"),lty=c(1,2,4),ylab="",ty="l",xlab="U")
abline(h=0,lty="dotted")
abline(v=c(1/4,1/2,3/4),lty="dotted")

```

* Now we're going to use white noise as a building block for various other time series models.

<br>

---------

--------

### Reminder: why do we need time series models?

* All statistical tests (i.e., whenever we use data to answer a question) rely on having a model for the data. The model is sometimes called the **assumptions** for the test.

* If our model is wrong, then any conclusions drawn from it may be wront. Our error could be small and insignificant, or disastrous.
 
* Time series data collected close in time are often more similar than a model with IID variation would predict. We need models that have this property, and we must work out how to test interesting hypotheses for these models.

<br>

----------

## Autoregressive models

### The AR(p) autoregressive model

* The AR(p) model is
<br><br>
[M1] $\quad\quad \quad X_n = \phi_1 X_{n-1}+\phi_2X_{n-2}+\dots+\phi_pX_{n-p} + \epsilon_n$,
<br><br>
where $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a white noise process. 


* Often, we consider the **Gaussian AR(p)** model, where  $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a Gaussian white noise process. 

* M1 is a **stochastic difference equation**. It is a [difference equation (also known as a recurrence relation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation) since each time point is specified recursively in terms of previous time points. Stochastic just means random.

* To complete the model, we need to **initialize** the solution to the stochastic difference equation. Supposing we want to specify a distribution for $X_{1:N}$, we have some choices in how to set up the **initial values**.

    1. We can specify $X_{1:p}$ explicitly, to get the recursion started.

    2. We can specify $X_{1-p:0}$ explicitly.

    3. For either of these choices, we can define these initial values either to be additional parameters in the model (i.e., not random) or to be specified random variables.

    4. If we want our model is strictly stationary, we must initialize so that $X_{1:p}$ have the proper joint distribution for this stationary model.

* Let's investigate a particular Gaussian AR(1) process, as an exercise.
<br><br>
[M2] $\quad\quad \quad X_n = 0.6 X_{n-1}+ \epsilon_n$,
<br><br>
where $\epsilon_n\sim \mathrm{IID} N[0,1]$. We will initialize with $X_1\sim N[0,1.56^2]$.

<br>

### Simulating an autoregressive model 

* Looking at simulated sample paths is a good way to get some intuition about a random process model. 

* We will do this for the AR(1) model M2

* One approach is to use the `arima.sim` function in R.

```{r ar_arima_sim,fig.width=4}
set.seed(123456789)
ar1 <- arima.sim(list(ar=0.6),n=100,sd=1)
plot(ar1,type="l")
```

* Does your intuition tell you that these data are evidence for a model with a linear trend?

* The eye looks for patterns in data, and often finds them even when there is no strong statistical evidence. 

* That is why we need statistical tests!

* It is easy to see patterns even in white noise. Dependent models produce spurious patterns even more often.

* Play with simulating different models with different seeds to train your intuition.

* A direct approach to simulating model M2 is to write out the model equation explicitly.

```{r ar_sim,fig.width=4}
set.seed(123456789)
N <- 100
X <- numeric(N)
X[1] <- rnorm(1,sd=1.56)
for(n in 2:N) X[n] <- 0.6 * X[n-1] + rnorm(1)
plot(X,type="l")
```

* This looks very similar to the `arima.sim` simulation, except for a difference near the start. Can you explain this? Hint: How does `arima.sim` initialize the simulation?

<br>

## Moving average models

### The MA(q) moving average model

* The MA(q) model is
<br><br>
[M3] $\quad\quad \quad X_n =  \epsilon_n +\theta_1 \epsilon_{n-1} +\dots+\theta_q\epsilon_{n-q}$,
<br><br>
where $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a white noise process. 

* To fully specify $X_{1:N}$ we must specify the joint distribution of $\epsilon_{1-q:N}$.

* Often, we consider the **Gaussian MA(q)** model, where  $\{\epsilon_n\}$ is a Gaussian white noise process. 

* Let's investigate a particular Gaussian MA(2) process, as an exercise.
<br><br>
[M4] $\quad\quad \quad X_n = \epsilon_n + 1.5\epsilon_{n-1}+\epsilon_{n-2}$,
<br><br>
where $\epsilon_n\sim \mathrm{IID} N[0,1]$.

### Simulating a moving average model 

* Let's simulate M4 using both the methods we tried for the autoregressive model

```{r ma_sim}
N <- 100
set.seed(123456789)
X1 <- arima.sim(list(ma=c(1.5,1)),n=N,sd=1)
set.seed(123456789)
epsilon <- rnorm(N+2)
X2 <- numeric(N)
for(n in 1:N) X2[n] <- epsilon[n+2]+1.5*epsilon[n+1]+epsilon[n]
oldpars <- par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(X1,type="l")
plot(X2,type="l")
par(oldpars)
```

* `X1` and `X2` look identical. We can check this
```{r check}
all(X1==X2)
```

* Perhaps you agree that the spurious evidence for a trend that we saw for the AR(1) model is still somewhat present for the MA(2) simulation.

* We could be curious about what the underlying white noise process looks like

```{r noise_sim,fig.width=4}
N <- 100
set.seed(123456789)
epsilon <- rnorm(N)
plot(epsilon,type="l")
```

* To me, the trend-like behavior is not visually apparent in the white noise that "drives" the AR and MA models.
