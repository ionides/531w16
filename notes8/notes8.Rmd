* Estimating a nonparametric trend from a time series is known as smoothing. We will review some standard smoothing methods.

* We can also smooth the periodogram to estimate a spectral density.

* Many smoothers can be represented as linear filters. We will see that the statistical properties of linear filters for dependent (time-domain) stationary models can be conveniently studied in the frequency domain.

## A motivating example

* The economy fluctuates between periods of rapid expansion and periods of slower growth or contraction. 

* High unemployment is one of the most visible signs of a dysfunctional economy, in which labor is under-utilized, leading to hardships for many individuals and communities.

* Economists, politicians, businesspeople and the general public therefore have an interest in understanding fluctuations in unemployment.

* Economists try to distinguish between fundamental structural changes in the economy and the shorter-term cyclical booms and busts that appear to be a natural part of capitalist business activity.

* [Monthly unemployment figures](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNU04000000) for the USA are published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Measuring unemployment has subtleties, which should be acknowledged but are not the focus of our current exploration.

```{r data_unadj}
system("head unadjusted_unemployment.csv",intern=TRUE)
U1 <- read.table(file="unadjusted_unemployment.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
head(U1)
```

* The data are in a table, and we want a time series. Here's one way to do that.

```{r reshape}
u1 <- t(as.matrix(U1[2:13]))
dim(u1) <- NULL
date <- seq(from=1948,length=length(u1),by=1/12)
plot(date,u1,type="l",ylab="Percent unemployment (unadjusted)")
```
 
* We see seasonal variation, and perhaps we see business cycles on top of a slower trend.

* The seasonal variation looks like an additive effect, say an annual fluctation with amplitude around 1 percentage point. For many purposes, we may prefer to look at a measure of [monthly seasonally adjusted unemployment](http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000), which the Bureau of Labor Statistics also provides. 

```{r data_adj}
U2 <- read.table(file="adjusted_unemployment.csv",sep=",",header=TRUE)
u2 <- t(as.matrix(U2[2:13]))
dim(u2) <- NULL
plot(date,u1,type="l",ylab="percent",col="red")
lines(date,u2,type="l")
title("Unemployment. Raw (black) and seasonally adjusted (red)")
```
 
* As statisticians, we may be curious about how the Bureau of Labor Statistics adjusts the data, and whether this might introduce any artifacts that a careful statistician should be aware of.

* Let's look at what the adjustment does to the smoothed periodogram.

* To help R figure out units for plotting the spectrum, we're going to put our time series in the `ts` class. 


```{r adjustment_spectrum}
u1_ts <- ts(u1,start=1948,frequency=12)
u2_ts <- ts(u2,start=1948,frequency=12)
spectrum(ts.union(u1_ts,u2_ts),spans=c(3,5,3),main="Unemployment. Raw (black) and seasonally adjusted (red)")
```

### Question: Comment on what you learn from comparing these smoothed periodograms.

* Note: the `ts` class can also be useful for helping R choose other plotting options in a way appriate for time series. For example, 
```{r plot.ts}
plot(u1_ts)
```

* Note: For a report, we should add units to plots. Also, extra details (like `bandwith` in the periodogram plot) should be explained or removed.

## The transfer function (or frequency response function) of a smoother

* The ratio of the periodograms of the smoothed and unsmoothed time series is called the **transfer function** or **frequency response function** of the smoother.

* We can infer the frequency response of the smoother used by Bureau of Labor Statistics to deseasonalize the unemployment data.

```{r bls_filter}
s <- spectrum(ts.union(u1_ts,u2_ts),plot=FALSE)
```

* We need to figure out how to extract the bits we need from `s`

```{r s_names}
names(s)
```

```{r s_spec_dim}
dim(s$spec)
```

```{r s_transfer}
plot(s$freq,s$spec[,2]/s$spec[,1],type="l",log="y",
  ylab="frequency ratio", xlab="frequency",  
  main="frequency response (dashed lines at 0.9 and 1.1)")
abline(h=c(0.9,1.1),lty="dashed",col="red")
```

### Question: What do you learn from this frequency response plot?

### Loess smoothing

* Loess is a **Local linear regression** approach (perhaps an acronym for LOcally EStimated Surface?)

* The basic idea is quite simple: at each point in time, we carry out a linear regression (e.g., fit a constant, linear or quadratic polynomial) using only points close in time. Thus, we can imagine a moving window of points included in the regression.


* `loess` is an R implementation, with the fraction of points included in the moving window being scaled by the `span` argument. 

* Let's choose a value of the span that visually separates long term trend from business cycle.

```{r loess}
u1_loess <- loess(u1~date,span=0.5)
plot(date,u1,type="l",col="red")
lines(u1_loess$x,u1_loess$fitted,type="l")
```

* Now, we can compute the frequency response function for what we have done.

```{r loess_transfer}
s2 <- spectrum(ts.union(
  u1_ts,ts(u1_loess$fitted,start=1948,frequency=12)),
  plot=FALSE)
plot(s2$freq,s2$spec[,2]/s$spec[,1],type="l",log="y",
  ylab="frequency ratio", xlab="frequency", xlim=c(0,1.5),
  main="frequency response (dashed line at 1.0)")
abline(h=1,lty="dashed",col="red")
```

### Question: Describe the frequency domain behavior of this filter.

## Extracting business cycles: A band pass filter

* For the unemployment data, high frequency variation might be considered "noise" and low frequency variation might be considered trend.

* A band of mid-range frequencies might be considered to correspond to the business cycle.

* Let's build a smoothing operation in the time domain to extract business cycles, and then look at its frequency response function.

```{r cycles,fig.height=6}
u_low <- ts(loess(u1~date,span=0.5)$fitted,start=1948,frequency=12)
u_hi <- ts(u1 - loess(u1~date,span=0.1)$fitted,start=1948,frequency=12)
u_cycles <- u1 - u_hi - u_low
plot(ts.union(u1, u_low,u_hi,u_cycles),
  main="Decomposition of unemployment as trend + noise + cycles")
```

```{r freq_response}
spec_cycle <- spectrum(ts.union(u1_ts,u_cycles),
  spans=c(3,3),
  plot=FALSE)
freq_response_cycle <- spec_cycle$spec[,2]/spec_cycle$spec[,1]
plot(spec_cycle$freq,freq_response_cycle,
  type="l",log="y",
  ylab="frequency ratio", xlab="frequency", xlim=c(0,1.2), ylim=c(5e-6,1.1),
  main="frequency response (dashed line at 1.0)")
abline(h=1,lty="dashed",col="red")  

```

### Question: Describe the frequencies (and corresponding periods) that this decomposition identifies as business cycles

* Note: Usually, we should specify units for frequency and period. Here, the units are omitted to give you an exercise!

* To help answer this question, let's add some lines to the previous plot

```{r show_range}
cut_fraction <- 0.5
plot(spec_cycle$freq,freq_response_cycle,
  type="l",log="y",
  ylab="frequency ratio", xlab="frequency", xlim=c(0,0.9), ylim=c(1e-4,1.1),
  main=paste("frequency response, showing region for ratio >", cut_fraction))
abline(h=1,lty="dashed",col="blue")  
freq_cycles <- range(spec_cycle$freq[freq_response_cycle>cut_fraction]) 
abline(v=freq_cycles,lty="dashed",col="blue") 
abline(h=cut_fraction,lty="dashed",col="blue")
```

```{r print_range}
kable(matrix(freq_cycles,nrow=1,dimnames=list("frequency",c("low","hi"))),digits=3)
```

<br>

### Question: So far as we have opinions on business cycles, use them to criticize this decomposition.

## Common smoothers in R

* Above, we have used the **local regression smoother** `loess` but there are other options.

* Our immediate goal is to get practical experience using a smoother and then statistically assessing what we have done. 

* You can learn about alternative smoothers, and try them out, if you like.

* `ksmooth` is a [**kernel smoother**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_smoother).  The default periodogram smoother in `spectrum` is also a kernel smoother.

* `smooth.spline` is a [**spline smoother**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothing_spline).
